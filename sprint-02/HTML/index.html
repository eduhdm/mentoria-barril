            <p>The story begin with one child who`s born nowhere, curious about everything, lost per nature but 
    a warrior by blood, willing to know what is beyond the horizon, seeking the answer of why the world is
    soo ruthless, voracious, insatiable! The quest was about undestanding, soo maybe that child could one day 
    explain to people around him what we lost living in such a place with that condition, foolish child,
    the world will roll over you until nothing left inside but that is not the point for a headstrong as that 
    kid used to be and with the knowing that is going to hurt but he will not escape with life on that trip
    that the adult touch about life, and chicks dugs on scar guys soo the child take it backpack, it dool and 
    leave seeking for a place to call home! </p>
